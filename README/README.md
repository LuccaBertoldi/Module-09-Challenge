# 09 Challenge: Professional README Generator

## Description

This Project is a README Generator, where the user is able to log all the informations from his project and when executed it will generate his README file. It is a really cool aplication because it will save you time when producing your readme to the applications you need. My biggest problem on this challenge was to create the WritetoFile and the license function, I had to look online for examples and have help with youtube videos. 


## Installation

To use the README generator:

Clone this repository to your local machine.

Navigate to the directory of the cloned repository.

Open your terminal and run the following command to install the required npm packages:

npm install

## Usage

Once you have installed the necessary packages, you can generate a professional README.md file by running:

node index.js
Follow the prompts and enter the requested information about your project. After completing all the prompts, a README.md file will be generated in the root directory of the project.
